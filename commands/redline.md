Present the current work for human review. Use the request_human_review MCP tool to open the browser-based review interface where the user can highlight text and add inline comments.

Structure your review document with:
- Clear section headers (## Summary, ## Changes, ## Questions)
- Code references using [[file:path:line]] syntax for clickable links
- Numbered items for easy reference in comments

Wait for the user's feedback and incorporate their comments into your next steps.
